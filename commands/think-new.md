# New Thinking Session

Start a new thinking session by following these steps:

1. **List existing categories**: Check the `thoughts/` directory in this repo (`/Users/azulee/workspace/claude-config/thoughts/`) for existing subdirectories (categories).

2. **Ask user to select category**: Present the existing categories and ask the user to select one, or offer to create a new category.

3. **If creating new category**: Ask for the category name and create the subdirectory.

4. **Start session**: Confirm the category and begin a fresh thinking/brainstorming session. Ask the user what they'd like to think about or discuss.

Remember: Use `/think-save` to save this session when done, and `/think-resume` to continue later.
