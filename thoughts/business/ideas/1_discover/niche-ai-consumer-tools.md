## The Winning Formula

```
1. Pick ONE specific use case
2. Make it work in < 30 seconds
3. Make output shareable
4. Free tier for viral spread
5. Paid for volume/quality
```

**What NOT to do:**
- Build "AI for everything"
- Require training/learning
- Hide results behind paywall completely
- Compete with ChatGPT directly

---

## Key Questions to Research

- [ ] What AI tasks do people currently struggle with?
- [ ] What's the API cost for different AI tasks?
- [ ] Which outputs are most shareable (viral)?
- [ ] What's the willingness to pay for different tasks?
- [ ] What existing tools have poor UX?
- [ ] What's underserved by current AI tools?

---

## Technical Considerations

**API Options:**
- OpenAI (GPT-4, DALL-E, Whisper)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Stability AI (images)
- Replicate (various models)
- Hugging Face (open models)
- ElevenLabs (voice)

**Cost considerations:**
- Image generation: ~$0.02-0.10 per image
- Text generation: ~$0.01-0.10 per 1K tokens
- Voice: ~$0.01-0.10 per minute
- Video: More expensive

**MVP approach:**
- Use APIs, don't train models
- Simple UI (input → output)
- Stripe for payments
- Usage-based or credit system

---

## Go-to-Market Ideas

1. **Free tool → viral**: Give away basic version
2. **TikTok/Reels**: Show before/after
3. **SEO**: "AI [task] generator free"
4. **Product Hunt**: AI tools do well
5. **Twitter/X**: Share impressive outputs

---

## Monetization Models

| Model | Example | Pros | Cons |
|-------|---------|------|------|
| **Credits** | Buy credits, use as needed | Low commitment | Revenue unpredictable |
| **Subscription** | $9-29/month unlimited | Predictable | Higher churn |
| **Freemium** | Free basic, paid premium | Viral growth | Conversion challenge |
| **Pay-per-use** | $1-5 per output | Simple | No recurring |

---

## Risk Factors

- **API costs**: Can eat margins if not careful
- **Competition**: Low barrier = many competitors
- **Model changes**: API providers can change/deprecate
- **Commoditization**: Features become standard quickly

**Mitigation:**
- Build moat through UX, not AI
- Create community/brand
- Add features AI can't easily replicate
- Own the niche audience
