# Niche CRM Opportunity

## Why This Opportunity?

From micro-SaaS research: **HubSpot charges $800/mo** for basic features. Huge gap for simple, affordable niche CRMs.

The "Simpler X" formula applies perfectly:
1. HubSpot/Salesforce = bloated, expensive, enterprise-focused
2. Pick ONE niche (coaches, agencies, freelancers, real estate)
3. Build ONLY what they need, 10x simpler
4. Price 50-80% lower ($20-50/mo vs $800/mo)

### Competitor Reviews Analysis

#### HoneyBook (4.5★ G2, 4.7★ Capterra)

| Complaint | Frequency | Our Opportunity |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Mobile app limited | High | Build mobile-first |
| Payment deposits slow (days vs next-day) | Medium | Faster payouts |
| Setup overwhelming | High | 5-min setup |
| Freezes/slow performance | Medium | Fast, lightweight |
| No internal task delegation | Medium | Team features |
| Cost concerns for freelancers | High | Lower price |
| "Extremely slow, not intuitive" | Medium | Better UX |

#### Dubsado (4.1★ G2)

| Complaint | Frequency | Our Opportunity |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| "Clunky, overwhelming, not user-friendly" | Very High | Simple by default |
| Steep learning curve | Very High | No learning curve |
| Customer service declined | High | Great support |
| Constant bugs and errors | High | Stable, tested |
| Feels stuck/vendor lock-in | Medium | Easy export |
| "2+ years still not using features fully" | High | Opinionated, fewer features |

**Key quote:** *"Dubsado has such an active Facebook group because it's so hard to set up, and there are people who literally specialize in Dubsado setup as part of their career."*

### Why Existing Tools Fail Coaches

> "HoneyBook was built for freelancers and creative professionals, not for coaches who guide clients through structured journeys, track goals, or measure long-term growth."

> "Both HoneyBook and Dubsado are **project-focused instead of client-focused**, which means they don't offer much in terms of deep client records."

**Core gap:** No goal tracking, no progress measurement, no coaching-specific workflows.

### Pricing Landscape Gap

| Tool | Price | Client Limit | Model |
|------|-------|--------------|-------|
| Simply.Coach | $9-69/mo | 5-unlimited | Tiered |
| Paperbell | $57/mo | Unlimited | Flat |
| CoachAccountable | $20-400/mo | 2-100 | Per-client |
| HoneyBook | $16-66/mo | - | Tiered |
| Dubsado | $20-40/mo | - | Tiered |

**Gap identified:** No simple, affordable option at $19-29/mo with unlimited clients.

## Current Solutions & Their Problems

### For Coaches

| Tool | Price | Main Complaints |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **HoneyBook** | $16-66/mo | Complex workflows, 3% payment fees, no Stripe/PayPal |
| **Dubsado** | $17-33/mo | Steep learning curve, confusing interface |
| **Paperbell** | $47-97/mo | Limited customization |
| **Simply.Coach** | $9-49/mo | Newer, less proven |

**Core problem:** "CRMs are built with sales pipelines in mind, not coaching sessions. They come loaded with dashboards, deal tracking, and forecasting tools that don't map to how coaches actually work."

### For Agencies

| Tool | Price | Main Complaints |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Monday.com** | $10+/user | Becomes expensive at scale |
| **Productive** | $9+/user | Still complex for small agencies |
| **ManyRequests** | $99/mo | Overkill for solos |
| **Workamajig** | Enterprise | Too complex |

### For Freelancers

| Tool | Price | Main Complaints |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **HubSpot Free** | $0 | Upsell pressure, limited |
| **Pipedrive** | $15+/user | Sales-focused, not freelance |
| **Moxie** | Varies | All-in-one but learning curve |

### Modern Alternatives (New Wave)

| Tool | Price | Focus | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| **Folk CRM** | $24/user/mo | Simple, LinkedIn-focused | $4.5M raised |
| **Attio** | $34/user/mo | Customizable, data-rich | $31M raised |

**Note:** Folk and Attio are general-purpose, not niche-specific. Opportunity to be "Folk for coaches" or "Attio for agencies."
