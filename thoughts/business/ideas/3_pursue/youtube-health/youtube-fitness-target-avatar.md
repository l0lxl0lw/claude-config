---

## Current Behavior Patterns

### What They're Doing Now:
- Googling "best workout for busy professionals"
- Watching Jeff Nippard but feeling overwhelmed by science
- Downloading apps (Strong, FitBod) but not sticking with them
- Buying home equipment that collects dust
- Starting and stopping every few months
- Following fitness accounts on IG but not taking action
- Reading Reddit r/fitness but getting confused by conflicting advice

### Where They Hang Out Online:
- YouTube (primary)
- Reddit (r/fitness, r/over30, r/naturalbodybuilding)
- LinkedIn (professional identity)
- Twitter/X (tech/business crowd)
- Podcasts during commute

### What They've Tried:
- P90X / Insanity (too intense, couldn't sustain)
- Planet Fitness (felt aimless)
- Personal trainer (expensive, didn't stick)
- Random YouTube programs (too complicated)
- Apps like Peloton, Apple Fitness+ (cardio-focused, not what they want)

---

## What They Actually Want

1. **Permission to do less** - Validation that 3x/week is enough
2. **Simple rules** - Not 47 variables to optimize
3. **Sustainable results** - Not a 12-week transformation, a lifestyle
4. **Respect for their intelligence** - Don't talk down, but simplify
5. **Realistic expectations** - What can a natural 35yo actually achieve?
6. **A clear path** - Just tell me exactly what to do
7. **Proof it works** - Show real results from normal people
8. **No judgment** - Meet them where they are
