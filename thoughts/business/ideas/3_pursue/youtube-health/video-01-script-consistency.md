## HOOK (0:00–0:10)

Motivation is a lie. Discipline is overrated. And after years of starting and quitting the gym, I finally figured out what actually works.

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:10–1:30)

I've started and quit fitness more times than I can count.

I'd get motivated, sign up for a gym, go hard for a few weeks, maybe a couple months if I was lucky — and then life would happen. Work gets busy. I'd miss a day. Then two. Then I just... stop.

And every time I'd tell myself the same thing: "I just need more discipline. I just need to push harder. I need to want it more."

So I'd try again. Download a new app. Follow a new program. Watch another YouTube video telling me to wake up at 5am and embrace the grind.

And it never stuck.

Look, I'm a simple guy. I wear the same black t-shirts every day. My underwear? Kirkland brand from Costco. I don't need variety — I need things that work and don't require thinking.

But when it comes to fitness, I kept overcomplicating it. And life made it easy to quit. Kids. Work. The endless busyness of being a dad. There's always a reason to skip the gym. "I'll start again Monday." For years, that was my life.

Here's what nobody tells you: that advice — "just be more disciplined" — it's for people who are already consistent. It doesn't help you become consistent. It just makes you feel like a failure when you're not.

The problem was never my motivation. The problem was never my discipline. The problem was I didn't have a system.

About a year ago, something finally clicked. And I want to show you the four things that actually changed.

---

## SHIFT 1: MORNING, NON-NEGOTIABLE (1:30–2:45)

The first thing I changed was when I work out.

I used to go to the gym after work. And it made sense, right? I'm done with my day, I've got time, I'll just swing by the gym on the way home.

Except that never happened. By 5 or 6pm, I'm mentally done. Something always came up — a meeting ran late, I'm tired, I just want to go home. And so I'd skip it. "I'll go tomorrow."

So I moved my workout to the morning. First thing. Before work, before emails, before the day has a chance to derail me.

And here's the key — it's not about being a morning person. I'm not. I don't wake up energized and ready to lift. I wake up tired like everyone else.

But the gym happens before I have a chance to talk myself out of it. The alarm goes off, I get up, I go. No thinking. No negotiating with myself. It's just what happens in the morning.

When you work out in the morning, you remove the decision. And that's the whole point. Decisions are where you fail.

---

## SHIFT 2: A ROUTINE I DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT (2:45–4:00)

The second thing I changed was my actual routine.

I used to spend way too much time thinking about the "perfect" program. What split should I do? How many sets? What exercises? Should I be doing this or that for my chest? Am I missing something?

And that overthinking would paralyze me. I'd switch programs every few weeks. Never stick to anything long enough to see results.

Now I do Push, Pull, Legs. That's it. Two variations of each — so six workouts total — and I just rotate through them. Almost every day, I go to the gym and do the next one in the sequence. My goal is simple: hit each body part about twice a week.

Same exercises. Same order. I don't think about it.

And here's the thing — it's boring. There's nothing special about it. No periodization, no advanced techniques, no secrets.

But boring works. Boring is sustainable. The optimized program you quit after three weeks doesn't work. The boring program you actually show up for? That's the one that gets results.

---

## SHIFT 3: REMOVE EATING DECISIONS (4:00–5:15)

Third shift: I fixed my eating. And I did it by making it as brainless as possible.

This is going to sound on-brand for me, but I solved this the same way I solve everything — by making it as boring and repeatable as possible. Same way I buy the same black shirts, same Kirkland underwear, same everything.

For years, nutrition was my weak point. I knew I needed to eat more protein. I knew I should meal prep. But I'd always fall off. Cooking felt like a chore, I'd forget to prep on Sundays, and by Wednesday I'm just eating whatever.

This January, I finally cracked it. And the system is embarrassingly simple.

Every week, I grab a couple rotisserie chickens from Costco. They're like five bucks each, already cooked. I shred them up, make a big batch of rice, portion it out into containers, and throw them in the freezer.

That's it. That's my lunch for the week. Chicken and rice. I grab one in the morning, it thaws by lunch, done.

Is it exciting? No. Is it optimal? Probably not. But I don't have to think about it. I don't have to cook. I don't have to decide what to eat.

I fill in the gaps with protein shakes. A shake in the morning, sometimes one after the gym. That gets my protein where it needs to be without any extra effort.

The key isn't eating perfectly. The key is removing decisions. When you don't have to think about what to eat, you just... eat what you're supposed to.

---

## SHIFT 4: LOWER THE BAR (5:15–6:30)

The fourth shift — and honestly, this one might be the most important — I lowered the bar.

I used to think every workout needed to be great. I needed to hit PRs, push myself, leave the gym exhausted. And if I couldn't do that? Why bother going?

That mindset is what made me quit. Because you can't bring your A-game every single day. Some days you're tired. Some days you're stressed. Some days you just don't have it.

So now, my only goal is to show up.

Some days I go to the gym and I crush it. Great. Some days I go and I'm just going through the motions, doing the minimum, counting down until I can leave. Also fine.

A bad workout is infinitely better than no workout. Because the real goal isn't gains — it's not breaking the streak.

Every time you skip a day, it gets easier to skip the next one. But every time you show up — even when you don't feel like it, even when it's a garbage workout — you're reinforcing the habit. You're proving to yourself that this is just what you do.

Lower the bar. Just show up. That's the whole game.

## MY RESULTS (6:30–7:30)

So where am I after a year of this?

I'm not going to stand here and show you some crazy transformation. I'm not shredded. I'm not jacked. I still have a long way to go.

But here's what I do have: I'm consistent.

I've been going to the gym almost every morning for a year. That's never happened before. Not even close.

I don't dread the gym anymore. I don't have to convince myself to go. It's just... what I do in the morning. Like brushing my teeth.

And yeah, I've made progress. I'm stronger than I was. I look better than I did. Not dramatic, but real. The kind of progress that comes from actually sticking with something.

I'm still figuring this out. I'm not an expert. I don't have all the answers.

I'm a dad who let fitness slide for years. Kids, work, life — it all came first. And I don't regret that. But this year I realized: if I don't make time for my health, I won't be around to enjoy what I was busy building.

But I'm not starting over anymore. And for someone who's quit a hundred times, that's everything.

---

## CTA + CLOSE (7:30–8:15)

If you've started and stopped a hundred times like I have — you're not lazy. You're not lacking discipline. You just didn't have a system that works for your actual life.

That's what I'm documenting here. What's actually working for me. The boring stuff. The simple stuff. No hacks, no secrets, just systems.

See you in the next one.
