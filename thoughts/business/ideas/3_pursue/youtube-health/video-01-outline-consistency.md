# Video 01: "How I Finally Became Consistent (After Years of Failing)"

**Created:** January 11, 2026
**Target Length:** 8-10 min | **Type:** Mindset/Story | **Angle:** Journey

---

## CONTRARIAN HOOK (0:00–0:10)
> "Motivation is a lie. Discipline is overrated. After years of starting and quitting, here's what actually made me consistent."

---

## PHILOSOPHY/CONTEXT (0:10–1:30)
*The problem with conventional "just be disciplined" advice*

- "I've started and quit fitness more times than I can count"
- Tried willpower, motivation, discipline — none of it stuck
- The advice online is for people who are already consistent
- What nobody tells you: **systems beat discipline every time**

**Transition:** "About a year ago, something finally clicked. Let me show you what changed."

## TECHNICAL EXPLANATION — THE 4 SHIFTS (1:30–5:30)
*60% of video — the practical systems*

### Shift 1: Morning, Non-Negotiable (1:30–2:30)
- Gym happens before the day can derail it
- Not about being a "morning person" — about removing decisions
- The alarm goes off, I go. No thinking.

### Shift 2: A Routine I Don't Have to Think About (2:30–3:30)
- Push/Pull/Legs — 2 variations, rotate through
- Same exercises, same order, almost every day
- Goal: hit each body part 2x/week
- "Boring works. Optimized programs don't."

### Shift 3: Remove Eating Decisions (3:30–4:30)
- January I finally fixed nutrition
- The system: Costco rotisserie chicken + rice, batch frozen
- Protein shakes fill the gaps
- Not perfect. Just repeatable.

### Shift 4: Lower the Bar (4:30–5:30)
- Stopped chasing "optimal"
- Some days I just show up and do the minimum
- A bad workout beats no workout
- "The goal is to never break the streak"

## PERSONAL APPLICATION/PROOF (5:30–7:00)
*Show the results + honest reflection*

- Where I was a year ago vs now (show photos/footage if available)
- Not jacked — but consistent. And that's the point.
- I don't dread the gym anymore. It's just what I do.
- "I'm still figuring it out, but I'm not starting over anymore."

**Key line:** "The best program is the one you don't quit."

---

## CTA + CLOSE (7:00–8:00)
> "If you've started and stopped a hundred times like I have — you're not lazy. You just didn't have a system. I'm documenting what's actually working for me. Subscribe if you want to follow along."

- End screen: Subscribe button + related video (e.g., meal prep or PPL routine)
- Confident, not begging
