# YouTube Fitness Channel - First Video Ideas

**Created:** January 11, 2026
**Angle:** Journey/Progress (not authority)

---

## Context: Why Journey Angle

- Not jacked yet, but significantly better than 1 year ago
- Credibility comes from consistency and relatability, not physique
- Avatar connects more with "guy figuring it out" than "another jacked influencer"

---

## Current Situation (Your Story)

- **Training:** Push/Pull/Legs with 2 variations, almost daily, hitting body parts 2x/week
- **Schedule:** Morning gym sessions (consistency win)
- **Nutrition:** Recently dialed in (January 2026)
  - Protein drinks/shakes
  - Meal prep: Costco rotisserie chicken + rice, frozen in batches
  - ~$50/week approach
- **Progress:** 1 year of visible improvement

## First Video Ideas

| # | Title | Type | Hook |
|---|-------|------|------|
| 1 | **"How I Finally Became Consistent (After Years of Failing)"** | Mindset/Story | Your story of what changed — mindset + systems |
| 2 | **"My $50/Week Meal Prep (Costco Rotisserie Hack)"** | Practical/Searchable | Your actual system, budget-friendly, no cooking skills needed |
| 3 | **"1 Year of Lifting: What Actually Changed"** | Progress/Honest | Before/after (even if subtle), honest progress update |
| 4 | **"The Push/Pull/Legs Routine I Actually Stick To"** | Program/Actionable | Your exact split, why it works for busy schedules |
| 5 | **"I Go to the Gym Every Morning — Here's How"** | Habit/Routine | Speaks to consistency struggle, morning routine breakdown |

## Recommended First Video

### Option A: #1 "How I Finally Became Consistent"
- Establishes channel identity from day one
- "Guy who figured it out" not "guy who's always been fit"
- Sets up future content naturally

### Option B: #3 "1 Year of Lifting: What Actually Changed"
- Visual proof of progress (honest, not exaggerated)
- Sets realistic expectations for viewers
- Strong before/after hook even if gains are modest

---

## Content Sequence Suggestion

1. **Video 1:** #1 or #3 (establish positioning)
2. **Video 2:** #2 Costco meal prep (practical, searchable)
3. **Video 3:** #4 PPL routine (actionable program)
4. **Video 4:** #5 Morning gym habit (lifestyle)
5. **Video 5:** Progress update or myth-busting

## Notes

- Thumbnails can show progress/effort rather than peak physique
- Honesty about "still figuring it out" builds trust with avatar
- Document the journey — footage now becomes before content later
- Costco meal prep video has high search potential

*Reference: Pivoted from authority angle after assessing current physique. Journey positioning aligns better with authenticity and avatar pain points (past failures, intimidation, unrealistic expectations from enhanced lifters).*
