**Created:** January 11, 2026
**Based on:** Average To Jacked channel analysis (0 → 102K in 10 months)

## Shooting Style & Setup

### Minimalist Production (Proven to Work)

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Primary Setup** | Talking head in home environment (simple background) |
| **B-Roll** | Commercial gym footage showing exercises |
| **Lighting** | Moody, slightly desaturated color grade |
| **Wardrobe** | Consistent signature look (same fitted shirt style) |
| **Graphics** | Minimal - no flashy animations or text overlays in video |
| **Camera** | Stationary, face-on framing |

### Why Minimalist Works for This Avatar:
- Feels authentic, not "influencer-y"
- Low barrier to start producing
- Matches anti-complexity brand message
- Target demo (30-45 professionals) values substance over flash

## Thumbnail Strategy (CRITICAL)

### The Data (From ATJ Analysis):

| Thumbnail Type | Performance |
|----------------|-------------|
| **With bold text overlay** | 802K views (top performer) |
| **Physique only, no text** | 39K views (underperformer) |

**Conclusion:** Text thumbnails outperform by 20x

### Thumbnail Formula:

```
REQUIRED ELEMENTS:
1. Physique visible (arms, torso) - shows credibility
2. BOLD TEXT (2-4 words max) in white or yellow
3. High contrast against dark background
4. Curious or confident expression
5. Consider tier list graphics for exercise videos

AVOID:
- Same outfit/location/angle for every thumbnail (too similar)
- Low contrast (dark shirt on dark background)
- No text at all
- More than 4 words
```

### Thumbnail Text Examples:

| Video Topic | Thumbnail Text |
|-------------|----------------|
| Simple workout | "THIS SIMPLE" |
| 3-day program | "ONLY 3 DAYS" |
| Exercise ranking | "S-TIER" |
| Myth-busting | "IT'S A LIE" |
| Diet advice | "EAT THIS" |

---

## Video Length Strategy

### The 8-Minute Rule (Revenue Optimization):

| Length | Ad Format | Revenue Impact |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Under 8 min | Pre-roll only | Baseline |
| 8+ minutes | Pre-roll + mid-roll | **50-100% more revenue** |

**Key insight:** ATJ's best video (802K views) is exactly 8:03

### How to Extend to 8+ Minutes:
- Add more examples/demonstrations
- Include Q&A section addressing common questions
- Show "what NOT to do" comparisons
- Add personal story/context
- Include actionable implementation steps

### Ideal Length by Content Type:

| Content Type | Optimal Length |
|--------------|----------------|
| Deep dive / program | 10-15 min |
| Myth-busting | 8-10 min |
| Exercise breakdown | 8-12 min |
| Shorts (discovery) | 30-60 sec |

---

## Hook Formula (First 5 Seconds)

### The Rule: Lead with CONTRARIAN, not CONTEXT

**BAD (Context first):**
> "One of the questions I get asked most is..."
> "So today I wanted to talk about..."
> "Hey guys, welcome back to the channel..."

**GOOD (Contrarian hook):**
> "Most people's reps are worthless. Here's why I pause every single one."
> "You're wasting your time in the gym. Let me explain."
> "Everything you've been told about protein is wrong."

### Hook Templates:

```
1. [Bold claim]. Here's why.
2. Stop doing [common thing]. Do this instead.
3. [Number]% of people get [topic] completely wrong.
4. I [achieved result] by doing the opposite of what everyone says.
5. The fitness industry doesn't want you to know this.
```

---

## Video Structure Blueprint

### The 60/40 Rule: 60% practical / 40% philosophical

```
STRUCTURE (for 8-10 min video):

1. CONTRARIAN HOOK (0:00-0:10)
   - Bold statement that challenges common belief
   - No intro, no "hey guys"

2. PHILOSOPHY/CONTEXT (0:10-1:00)
   - Why this matters
   - The problem with conventional wisdom
   - Your unique perspective

3. TECHNICAL EXPLANATION (1:00-5:00)
   - The actual how-to
   - Step-by-step breakdown
   - Key principles (keep it simple)

4. PERSONAL APPLICATION/PROOF (5:00-7:00)
   - Your experience using this
   - Results you've seen
   - Real examples

5. STRONG CTA + END SCREEN (7:00-8:00)
   - Clear next step for viewer
   - Subscribe button visible
   - Related video suggestion
```

## Title Formulas (Proven Viral)

### Top Performing Patterns:

| Formula | Example | Views |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Contrarian + Simplicity** | "Unfortunately, Fitness Really Is This Simple" | 802K |
| **Result + Minimal Effort** | "How I Got Jacked Training 3 Days a Week" | 607K |
| **Value Compression** | "It Took Me 10 Years... What I'll Teach You in 5 Minutes" | 507K |
| **Tier List** | "My S-Tier Exercises for Getting Jacked" | 291K |
| **Actionable + Outcome** | "The Simple Diet That Gets You Lean" | 254K |

### Title Templates:

```
SIMPLIFICATION:
- "Unfortunately, [Topic] Is This Simple"
- "[Topic] is Simpler Than You Think"
- "The Only [X] You Need to [Result]"

VALUE COMPRESSION:
- "[Big Number] Years... [Small Number] Minutes"
- "Everything I Know About [Topic] in [Time]"

RESULT + METHOD:
- "How I [Result] by [Minimal Method]"
- "I [Achieved Result] With [Surprisingly Little]. Copy This."

CONTRARIAN:
- "Why [Common Belief] is Wrong"
- "[Popular Thing] is a Waste of [Time/Money]"
- "Stop [Common Action] - Do This Instead"

TIER/RANKING:
- "My S-Tier [Things] for [Result]"
- "The [Adjective] [Thing] That Got Me Jacked"
```

### What DOESN'T Work:

| Title | Views | Why It Failed |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| "The Hidden Rep Method That Got Me Jacked" | 39K | Vague, no text thumbnail |
| "Most Supplements Are Waste of Money" | 7.2K | Negative framing, saturated topic |

---

## Shorts Strategy

### Purpose: Discovery engine for long-form

### Top Performing Shorts (ATJ Data):

| Short | Views |
|-------|-------|
| "You don't need much protein to get jacked" | 46K |
| "Mike Mentzer Was Right All Along..." | 46K |
| "These 4 Exercises Build Bigger Shoulders" | 32K |
| "Do THIS if you want to get jacked" | 32K |

### Shorts Best Practices:
- 30-60 seconds max
- One single idea per short
- Repurpose clips from long-form videos
- Contrarian hooks work well
- Direct, actionable advice
- End with implicit CTA (no "subscribe" begging)

### Shorts to Long-Form Ratio:
- 2-3 shorts per week
- 1-2 long-form per week
- Use shorts to test topics before making long-form

## SEO Optimization

### Current Gaps (What ATJ Does Wrong):

| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Descriptions are product-link dumps | Poor search ranking | Add 2-3 keyword-rich sentences BEFORE links |
| No chapters/timestamps | Missed search features | Add timestamps for key sections |
| Inconsistent tags | Algorithm confusion | Use consistent, relevant tags |

### Description Template:

```
[2-3 sentences summarizing video with keywords]

In this video, I break down [topic] and show you exactly how to [result].
If you're a [target audience] who wants [outcome], this is for you.

TIMESTAMPS:
0:00 - Hook
0:30 - [Section 1]
2:00 - [Section 2]
5:00 - [Section 3]
7:30 - Summary

MY PROGRAMS:
[Links]

FOLLOW ME:
[Social links]
```

### Tags to Use Consistently:
- natural bodybuilding
- minimalist fitness
- busy professional workout
- 3 day workout split
- simple workout routine
- muscle building for beginners
- [your channel name]
